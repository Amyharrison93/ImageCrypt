ImageCrypt

this is an experiemntal crypto key generation (soon to be) library that 
Uses opencv to convert images into useful information for random number generation.

Small experiment to see if a more random, random number generator can be created for cryptokey generation
using feature extraction to generate random numbers to then be converted into printable ascii. Results
from long term testing will be added to an appropriate folder showing how results vary depending on the image stream.

a library is being built that can be imported and at some point will be documented and made available through PIP.
