# RandomNumberFromImage2
Uses opencv to convert images into seeds for random number generation 
Small experiment to see if a more random, random number generator can be created for cryptokey generation
using feature extraction to generate random numbers to then be converted into printable ascii. 

the programs Test.py is intended to be used to gather and print data as such will print the graph generated
as well as the standard deviation of each channel as the header. 

the test.py will be used to generate a usable function for image based random character generation at a 
later date once the reliability can be proven.
